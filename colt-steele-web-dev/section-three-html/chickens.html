    <p>
      The <b>chicken</b> <i>(Gallus domesticus)</i> is a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication">domesticated</a>
      bird, with attributes of wild species such as the red and grey
      junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock
      is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a
      cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird
      is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.

      Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens
      were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th-2nd centuries
      BC).[2][3] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food
      (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.
