# Web Development course

All of the code in this folder were written by following and doing the creative exercises from Colt Steele's Web Development course on udemy (2022 edition.)

## Technologies learned

### HTML

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language originally written to describe academic papers. It is not a programming language (neither is CSS.) It sets the structure for a document.

#### Topics

Tables, forms, the latest in HTML5 semantics, ARIA accessibility, SEO practices such as using the alt attributes for images and adding labels to input types, differences between front end/client side and back-end/server side (when trying to load a webpage, the browser sends a request to a server for a resource via an URL, the server sends back instructions to the browser on how to construct and interpet the resource for the user via HTML/CSS/JS,) and more.

### CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to style the structure (HTML) of a document. When CSS is written, the code is caled rules. The property is what element is being styled, and the value is what the element is being styled to. The selector is the signifier that tells us what element that the rule is being applied to, and (usually) ensures that the rule is only applied to it (i.e., styling a certain H1 blue.) CSS files are normally linked in an external style sheet in documents, so multiple pages can use the styling.

#### Topics

Color systems, text-properties, proper inline and external syntax, psuedo-classes, selectors, psuedo-elements, cascading (the order stylesheets and rules are declared in matters,) specificity, !important, inheritance (child elements will normally inherit rules set for their parents,)
